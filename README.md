# About the project
#### This project is a Rubik's Cube solver designed to find the quickest solution to your given Rubik's Cube. It employs Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to achieve this goal, which is why it might be slow finding solutions for complex cube configurations, just to provide the quickest possible solution

# Key Achievements

#### * Encoded Rubik’s cube and the operations (moves) done to it
#### * Implemented a simulation of 18-way tree specific for the problem 
#### * Implemented the logic of BFS to find the fastest possible solution (at the expense of computational power)
#### * Finished the project to be built from scratch (just imported some key java libraries to handle arrays)
#### * Could solve a 7-moves shuffled Rubik’s cubes in only 5 moves in less than 2 seconds
 * Could solve another 7-moves shuffled Rubik’s cubes in only 6 moves in around a minute

# Requirements
#### Any `Java` version should work!

# Execution
#### locate the source code and execute it using the command:
```
java RC.java
```
# Demonstration
#### https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tjMPFxNt5oSCpc1TyPZtPsl4sxmpvLSO?usp=share_link

# Additional notes

#### Please, do not pay too much attention to the code itself. It was written more by a Rubik's Cube enthusiast than a seasoned programmer :D
#### The primary objective was to get the program up and running, no matter how the code might appear xD
#### Just run it, provide your Rubik's Cube configuration, and patiently await its calculation of the least number of moves needed to solve it.

#### Search for "unhash" in the source code:
#### the first hashed line would show serieses of moves tested during finding the solution
#### the other hashed line would show changes over the cube tested during finding the solution
